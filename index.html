                <p>
                    With a strong passion for technology, I thrive on solving complex problems using AI,
                    automation, and software development. I constantly explore machine learning, deep learning,
                    NLP, and web technologies to build intelligent and scalable applications. My expertise lies
                    in AI-driven solutions, full-stack web development. I enjoy experimenting with cutting-edge
                    AI models, working on real-world projects, and contributing to the tech community.
                    I believe in continuous learning, innovation, and staying ahead in the evolving world of AI & ML.
                    Beyond AI, I have a keen interest in ethical hacking, cloud computing, and automation.
                    My approach to technology is practicalâ€”I learn by building, experimenting, and refining my skills
                    through hands-on projects.I actively participate in hackathons, freelancing, and content creation.
                    Through my YouTube channel (AI Dugeoun), I create AI-generated videos, educating others about
                    science, technology, and AI innovations.I aim to use my knowledge and skills to develop
                    AI-powered solutions, contribute to open-source projects, and make a meaningful impact in the tech world.
